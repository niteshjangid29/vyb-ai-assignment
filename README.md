# Vyb AI Nutrition Estimator

This project solves the challenge of estimating the nutrition of home-cooked Indian dishes, even when the input is partial, messy, or ambiguous. It uses open-source LLMs and LangChain to create a robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable of understanding real-world cooking variations.

---

## Part 1: Core Pipeline

### Approach

- **Document Loading**: Nutrition DB, household unit reference, and dish category mapping are loaded using `langchain.document_loaders.CSVLoader`.
- **Text Embedding & Vector Store**: We used `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` as the embedding model and FAISS for vector indexing.
- **LLM Integration**: Used `mistralai/Mistral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.3` via HuggingFace and `ChatHuggingFace` wrapper for answering queries.
- **RetrievalQA Chain**: LangChain's `RetrievalQA` pulls relevant data chunks and feeds them to the LLM for question answering.
- **Prompting Strategy**: A structured query asks the model to extract ingredients, map units, resolve to Nutrition DB, calculate per-100g values, scale to 1 katori (150g), and identify the dish type.

Following is the input and output for this part:

## Part 2: Messy Reality (Edge Case Handling)

### Approach

- Extended the same LangChain pipeline from Part 1 to work with "real-world messy dish names".
- Created a natural language reasoning prompt that includes **dish name + issue list** (e.g., spelling variation, missing units).
- Let the LLM infer:
  - Ingredient synonyms (e.g., jeera â†’ cumin)
  - Unit approximations (e.g., glass â†’ 240 ml)
  - Dish type guesses (e.g., Gobhi Sabzi â†’ Dry Sabzi)
  - Default quantities if missing
- Added a **structured output format** to log assumptions, nutrition values, and dish type.

### Assumptions & Fallback Design

| Situation                              | Strategy                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Ingredient synonyms (e.g., jeera, alu) | Mapped via LLM context                       |
| Unknown units (e.g., glass)            | LLM assumes typical household values         |
| Missing quantities                     | LLM uses average Indian cooking quantities   |
| Ingredient not found in nutrition DB   | Ingredient skipped and logged                |
| Mixed/hybrid dish names                | LLM infers likely type (Dry Sabzi, Curry)    |
| Hinglish or spelling variation         | LLM handles through contextual understanding |

All assumptions are recorded and logged in a structured format per dish.

Following is the input and output for this part:

**Input:**

```json
[
  {
    "dish": "Jeera Aloo (mild fried)",
    "issues": ["ingredient synonym", "quantity missing"]
  },

  },
  {
    "dish": "Mixed veg",
    "issues": ["no fixed recipe", "ambiguous serving size"]
  }
]
```

**Output:**

```
ðŸŸ¡ Dish: Jeera Aloo (mild fried)

1. Jeera Aloo is a Hindi term which translates to "Cumin Potatoes" in English. It is a popular Indian side dish made with potatoes, cumin seeds, and a few other spices.

2. Assumed ingredients and estimated household quantities:

- Potatoes (Aloo): 500g
- Cumin Seeds (Jeera): 1 tbsp (15ml)

3. Unit ambiguity:

- tbsp: tablespoon
- ml: milliliter
- tsp: teaspoon
- g: gram
- katori: ~150g

4. Missing items:

- No specific quantity is given for any ingredient, so we will use estimated household quantities.

5. Mapping ingredients to nutrition DB entries:

- Potatoes (OSR104), Cumin Seeds (OSR101), Turmeric Powder (OSR105), Red Chilli Powder (OSR106), Coriander Powder (OSR107), Garam Masala (OSR108), Salt (OSR109), Vegetable Oil (OSR110), Fresh Coriander Leaves (OSR111)

5. Mapping ingredients to nutrition DB entries:

- Chickpeas: BFP151 (Masala dosa paneer fillings)
- Onion: OSR097


ðŸŸ¡ Dish: Paneer Curry with capsicum

1. The dish "Paneer Curry with capsicum" is a curry dish made with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) and capsicum (bell peppers) in a gravy-like sauce. The use of Hindi and English in the dish name suggests it's a fusion dish or a common dish in Indian-English communities.

2. Assumed ingredients and estimated household quantities:

- Paneer: 200g
- Capsicum (bell pepper): 1 large (~200g)
- Onion: 1 medium (~100g)
- Tomato: 2 medium (~200g)
- Ginger: 1 inch (~5g)
- Garlic: 3 cloves (~5g)
- Turmeric powder: 1/2 tsp (~1g)
- Coriander powder: 1 tbsp (~6g)
- Cumin powder: 1 tsp (~2g)
- Red chili powder: 1 tsp (~2g)

- Salt: to taste (~5g)
- Oil: 2 tbsp (~30ml)
- Water: 1 cup (~250ml)
- Fresh coriander leaves: for garnish (~10g)

3. Since there is no unit provided for 'glass', I'll assume it's a 250ml glass, which is a common household measure. I'll convert the 'glass' of oil to tbsp (1 glass = 8 tbsp).

4. For missing items, I'll provide fallback values based on common sense:

- Ginger: 1 inch (~5g)
- Garlic: 3 cloves (~5g)

5. Mapping ingredients to nutrition DB entries:

- Paneer (OSR001)
- Capsicum (OSR002)
- Onion (OSR003)
- Tomato (OSR004)
- Ginger (OSR005)

## Part 3: Manual Reasoning

### Mapping "lightly roasted jeera powder"

- Mapped to `Cumin (Jeera)`
- Reasoning: Light roasting and grinding do not significantly change macro-nutrient values. Therefore, it's valid to use the same nutrition entry as raw cumin seeds.

### Cooking Loss Ratio

- **Raw weight**: 950g
- **Cooked weight**: 700g
- **Loss ratio**:

  ```
  ((950 - 700) / 950) * 100 = 26.3%
  ```

- **Adjusted to 180g serving**:
  If nutrition is calculated for 700g, then:
  ```
  Per 180g = (180 / 700) Ã— Total Nutrition
  ```
